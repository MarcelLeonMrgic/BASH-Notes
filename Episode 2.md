==How to create and execute a Bash Script!==
	1. Note that you are root or write sudo in front of every instruction
	2. create the bash script via ```nano nameOfBashFile.sh```
	3. the very first line of every bash script should be ```#!/bin/bash``` !!! Your bash script might works without it but only if your shell is using bash as its default interpreter. So not writing it is a bad habit.
	4. tell the script what to do for example ```echo "Hello Beej" ```
	5. ```control o + Enter â†µ```  to save the file
	6. ```control x ```to leave the file
		1. now that we created our first bash script we have to give it permission via ```chmod +x nameOfBashFile.sh```
	7. to execute our first Bash file write ./nameOfBashFile.sh 
	It should look something like this:![[Screenshot 2024-12-27 at 09.11.55.png]]

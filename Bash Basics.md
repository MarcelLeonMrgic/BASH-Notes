These notes are based of "Learn Linux TV - Bashscripting for Beginners" course. This course helped me a lot in setting up my HOMESERVERâ„¢ and I can recommend it with only my best intentions. The reason these notes exist are not only to protocoll my learning path but also for quickly looking up knowledge and I hope that they are also useful for you. My writing style is inspired by Beej's Guide to socket programming so enjoy :-).
